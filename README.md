# demonstration application

This is our May 2015 top neural network for large-scale object recognition. It has been trained to recognize most typical home indoor/outdoor objects in our daily life. It was trained with more that 10 M images on a private dataset. It can serve as good pair of eyes for your machines, robots, drones and all your wonderful creations!

See it in action in this [video #1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wXHR-lad-Q), and also this other [video #2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0TreumQO-0).

This application is for thinkerers, hobbiest, researchers, evaluation purpose, non-commercial use only.

It has been tested on OS X 10.10.3 and Linux. It can run at > 17 fps on a MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013) on CPU only.


## install:
Install Torch7: http://torch.ch/

Please download files: `model.net`, `categories.txt` and `stat.t7` from https://www.dropbox.com/sh/qw2o1nwin5f1r1n/AADYWtqc18G035ZhuOwr4u5Ea?dl=0

Linux camera install: `cd lib/` then `make; make install`. Note that `Makefile` wants Torch7 installed in `/usr/local/bin`, otherwise please change accordingly!


## run:
To run with a webcam and display on local machine: ```qlua run.lua```

Zoom window by 2 (or any number): ```qlua run.lua -z 2```


## usage:
